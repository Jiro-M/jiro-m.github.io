- I was born in July 2000, [Ningde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningde), Fujian, China.

- I received the B. S. degree in [Automation](https://dqxy.fzu.edu.cn/en/), [Fuzhou University (FZU)](https://en.fzu.edu.cn/), 2022.

- I'm a Master's student of [Department of Automation](https://auto.xmu.edu.cn/) at [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm), supervised by [Prof. Aiwen Lai](https://aivens123.github.io/aiwenlai.github.io/).

- My general research interests include Discrete-Event Systems (DES), Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), and Formal Methods, with a particular interest in state estimation (detectability, diagnosability, opacity, and critical observability) and enforcement of weighted automata, and the application of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in DES.
